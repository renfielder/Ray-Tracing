Homework 7

creative scene: 
    scene e.creative_scene.html
    I call it "the fault in our mothman"

I tried to implement AO, pathtracing and textures, but couldnt finish any of it. The bones of those attempts litter my code. You can probably ignore the other scenes I added.
Also I had an approved extension until 5/7 with Dr. Wang's permission.


Thank you for a great semester and have a wonderful and safe summer.
